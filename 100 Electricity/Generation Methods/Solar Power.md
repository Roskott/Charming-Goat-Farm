---
## Overview

## Production type

## Availability
Solar Power is only available during clear days, though some power may be generated during cloudy days where the light is still good.

## Practicality
Solar power is relatively cheap, current technologies include [[Silicon Cells]], with upcoming [[Perovskite Cells]] coming into their own.

## Hazards
Limited. Due to the location where they may be installed, there may be a slip and fall hazard on roof tops.
