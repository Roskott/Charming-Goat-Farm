# Electricity
---
Just because this is a homestead and organic farm doesn't mean that we're suddenly going to be Amish. I dully intend this thing to have a/c and heat, electric lights, a modern cooking environment, and a small home entertainment area. 

Being that the farm is intended to be somewhat far and away from most civilization, it will likely be off grid in nature. To generate out own power will rely more directly on a combination of

[[Solar Power]]

[[Micro hydroelectric Generators]]

[[Wind Generators]]

[[Geothermal Generator]]

With some storage backup systems to maintain for occasions in which power generation cannot be performed easily. Some ideas on this are:

[[Hydrogen Fuel Cells]] 

[[Flywheel Energy Storage]]

[[Battery Backup]]

[[Ultracapacitor Array]]

Ideally, all AC circuits will be running on 220v.
