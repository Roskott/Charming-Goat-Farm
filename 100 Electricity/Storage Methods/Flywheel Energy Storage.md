# Flywheel Energy Storage

## Overview
Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) is basically a large, spinning, heavy weight balanced on an extremely low friction point. While there is electricity running, it continues to spin up to a set angular velocity. When power is lost, the momentum slowly leeches away, generating power.

## Practicality
The FES is not something at present that is practical for an individual to produce. Since the mass ideally is kept in a vacuum, it can be extremely difficult to procude without
