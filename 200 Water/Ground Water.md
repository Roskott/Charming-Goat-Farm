# Ground Water
---
Ground water is, as the name implies, subterranean in nature. Depending on the height of the water table, it is possible to drill a well to access it. 

This can be used for [[Irrigation]] depending on the salt content. 

Areas with good access can be identified using [[Ground Penetrating Radar]].
