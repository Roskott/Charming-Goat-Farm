## Drip-Flood Hybrid Watering
---
[[Rovers]] may be used as a bridge between [[Flood Irrigation]] and [[Drip Irrigation]], allowing more conservation of water.

In this set up, one of the rover tools is a misting water nozzle that can be used to target roots of specific plants. Benefits besides these are the reduction in risk of flooding sensitive neighboring crops.
