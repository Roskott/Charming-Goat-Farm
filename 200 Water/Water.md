# Water
---
Water is most likely going to come from a [[Ground Water|water well]] source, as well as [[Rain Water Collection]], If extremely lucky a [[Natural Water Source]] such as a river, brook, or stream may be available. Other than house hold uses, it will be required for [[Livestock]] and [[Irrigation]].
