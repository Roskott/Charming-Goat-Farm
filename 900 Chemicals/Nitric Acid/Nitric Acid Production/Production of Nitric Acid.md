# Nitric Acid Production
---
## Birkeland–Eyde process
---
The Birkeland–Eyde process is possibly the simplest method of producing Nitric Acid, all that is required Is a [[Jacob's Ladder]] in a mostly sealed container with an air inlet and outlet. The produced NO<sub>3 </sub> Is pumped through water to acidify it. After sufficient time, you have Nitric Acid.
