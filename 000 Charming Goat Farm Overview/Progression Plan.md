# Progression Plan
---
## Overview
---
If done all at once, this would be a massive cash sink, and therefore it needs to be parted out into at least decade long project. A house will not even be the first building to accommodate a good cash flow. 

Idealy we arrive in fall or early winter and are prepared for the first planting.
