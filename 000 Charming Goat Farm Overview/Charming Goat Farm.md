The Charming Goat Farm is a dream retirement plan, fully sustainable and organic in nature (more to reduce the need for outside resources to maintain operation). The goal is to produce a farm that can do a bit more than sustainance farming, and churn out enough profit to stave off poverty until death's sweet embrace takes us. 

Open source robotics projects will make it possible to expand the operation while not taking up too many man hours to stay operable. Since this is a retirement plan, and, you know I'd be in my silver/golden years at that point, I have to plan for not being physically fully capable. Brain power needs to augment physical power to make this work.
