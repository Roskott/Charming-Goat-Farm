## Grow Method
---
Potatoes grow in loose soil. 

<p>There is a method of growing potatoes that is not sustainable in a long term, but can be used to churn out an insane portion of potatoes. As the plant grows, you can add more soil to the base. The plant will put out more roots, and therefore grow more tubers. This strips the soil, but if it is tilled into the fields after being stripped, this will not be an issue. </p>

This method may not be factual, as it was derived from [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian), research must be performed to verify this.
