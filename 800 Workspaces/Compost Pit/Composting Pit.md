# Composting Pit
---
## Overview
---
The Composting Pit is an area, whether a building or a simple pit that's serves as a [[Disposal]] area for organic plant, manure, and fungus matter that has no immediate or further use. This is used to make [[Fertilizer]] for enriching soil anywhere plants are grown. 

Due to the smell, this should be kept in a relatively isolated area for quality of life purposes.
