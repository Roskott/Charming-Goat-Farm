# Fish Disposal
---
## Overview
---
Fish that are not used for food purposes are disposed of here, processed into [[Fish Fertilizer]]. 

Due to the smell, this needs to be kept isolated from the living area. 

Runoff and leeching is a problem with this area, and needs to be prevented to protect [[Water | Water Sources]].
