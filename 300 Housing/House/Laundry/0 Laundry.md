# Laundry
---
The Laundry is a smaller room near to the [[Master Bath]]. It takes the waste water from the bathtub and uses it to do the laundry.

In the Laundry you will find the following items

[[Wash Sink]]
[[Washing Machine]]
[[Indoor Drying Rack]]
[[Blower Fan]]
[[Dehumidifier]].

There is no drier in the Laundry due to the need to preserve [[101 Electricity Overview | Electricity]], during warm clear weather it is expected that the clothing will be hung out to dry on the [[Clothesline]], while any other time it will be allowed to dry in the Laundry room on the [[Indoor Drying Rack]]. The fan is there to speed the drying process, but is not necessarily needed at all times. The Dehumidifier recovers some of the water from this room, and may be added back to the water treatment tank by any of the [[Gray Water Sink | Gray Water Sinks]].
