## Overview 
---
These computing units are specialized to specific tasks, performing approximately 1 to 10 tasks each depending on the scenario. While they are likely more capable, for simplicity sake, it may be a better idea to keep them on the low end. 

On their surface, these devices may seem slow, the Pi Pico running at 133MHz, but when you consider that these are meant to do a very limited number of tasks, that system clock is entirely populated by your code, rather than system processes.

The microcontroller communicates with [[Sensor | Sensors]] to determine the conditions of a certain subject, and depending on the programming, a reaction may be taken based on specified criterea.
