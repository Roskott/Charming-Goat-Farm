# Terrestrial Farming Vehicles
---
## Overview
---
Terrestrial vehicles are the main method to process the [[Fields | Fields]]. These include things like the [[600 Electronic Systems/Terrestrial Farming Vehicles/Traditional Vehicles/Plow]], [[Harvester]], [[Planter]], and [[Herb Pest Control]]. 

"Traditional" methods use manual labor, manually driven tractors, or large automated vehicles. That costs quite a bit of cash, and can't be regarded as a good idea. Rather, many relatively small semi automated [[Rovers]] would be more ideal to attend to the needs of the [[Fields | Fields]] and [[Orchard | Orchard]].
