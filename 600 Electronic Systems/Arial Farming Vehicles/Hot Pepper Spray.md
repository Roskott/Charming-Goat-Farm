# Hot Pepper Spray 
---
Hot Pepper Spray is an irritating substance that can be used against most mammals. It can be used as a deterrent against [[Predators]].
One potential deployment is to use a [[Drones | Drone]] with an electronic pump to spray into the face of the target. 
This can be made from [[Peppers]] easily. A simple juice would be effective, though producing a [[Hot Sauce]] may be more beneficial to reducing superfluous products.
