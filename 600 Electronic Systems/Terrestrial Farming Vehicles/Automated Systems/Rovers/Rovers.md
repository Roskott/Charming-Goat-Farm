# Rovers
---
## Overview 
---
The Rovers are semiautomated farming implements, something like a really smart roomba. Using the detachable [[Rover Tools]] they are able to take on a large number of tasks. 

Rovers are a key aspect of the use of [[Drip-Flood Hybrid Irrigation]]. To modify then to do this, there will either need to be hose hookups distributed throughout the farm, or more simply a relatively large tank that can be attached at the [[Rover Base Stations]]. 

Depending on how things are set, instead of having a large number of sensors scattered through the [[Fields |fields]], a single array of sensors can be set onto a Rover to allow for a more decentralized implementation. 

## Sensor Array
---
Rovers should be expected to contain a [[Soil Moisture Sensor]], [[Soil pH Meter]], [[Air Temperature Sensor]], [[Humidity Sensor]], and [[Camera |Cameras]] (forward, backward, and ground facing).
