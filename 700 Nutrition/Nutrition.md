# Nutrition
---
Being that we are, again, living in the sticks, we need to maintain a complete diet with little interferance from outside sources. This is easier said than done. 

The human body requires 3 Macronutrients to function, with a large number of micronutrients to maintain homeostasis. For your average adult, 2000 [[Calories | Kilocalories]] are necessary to maintain weight. This can shift depending on the work load.

In this Vault, I have tagged crops and animal products with their associated most abundant nutrients.
