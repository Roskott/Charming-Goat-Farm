## Overview
---

A blast freezer, when you get right down to it, is simply a low temperature [[Freezer]] with a [[Blower Fan]] in it. The blower fan causes the temperature of the item placed in the freezer to drop at a significantly faster rate.

This method of freezing is superior to preserve the textures of food.

A Blast freezer tends to be used to do the initial freeze of a food, while a more traditional freezer is used to store more long term.
