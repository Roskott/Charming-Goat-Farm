# Canned Pickles
---
Canning pickles for [[Food Preservation]] is similar to [[Lactofermentation]] in product, but not process. Of note, the texture of canned pickles tends to be softer, and flavors more muted. 

Foods are added to a jar and covered with an acidic (generally [[White Vinegar|Vinegar]]) and brine (very high in [[Salt]]) and then either [[Pressure Canning | Pressure Canned]] or [[Hot Water Bath Canning | Hot Water Canned]]. 

To help fend off microbes, a specific pH level is required of the contents of the jar. 

Properly prepared canned pickles with a good seal will last almost indefinitely when stored in a cool dark place.
