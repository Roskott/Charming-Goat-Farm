# Lactofermentation
---
Lactofermentation is a [[Food Preservation]] technique using the naturally present [Lactobacillus](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus) to generate enough acid to kill any food spoiling microbe. 

These foods tend to stay crisper and fresher tasting than [[Canned Pickles]], but need to be refrigerated, and may only last up to 6 months in storage.
