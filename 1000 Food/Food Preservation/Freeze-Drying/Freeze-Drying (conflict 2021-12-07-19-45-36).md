# Freeze-drying 
---
Freeze-driying is a method of [[Food Preservation]], desicating food by freezing to -40Â°C, putting it under strong vacuum, and removing the moisture by sublimation. 

This method is perhaps the best method to preserve any non fatty food. As long as the products remain dry, and anaerobic, they will stay consumable nearly indefinitely.
