# SLS Manufacturing

## Overview
---
SLS manufacturing uses a laser to sinter metal or other material dust into a cohesive piece one layer at a time. Due to the ability to use metal, it can produce parts that are of immediate use and very good durability.

It is the most expensive [[Additive Manufacturing]] technique requiring a large amount of material that must be recovered between parts being printed. Due to the method that the material is sintered, there is no need to account for support material.
