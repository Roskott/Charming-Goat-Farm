## Overview
---

Often referred to as Resin Printing, SLA uses Ultraviolet Radiation to cure a resin into a rigid Plastic like material. Compared to other [[Additive Manufacturing]] techniques, it is capable of insanely good detail with limited visible layer lines.

Due to the use of resin, there is a large amount of post-processing required, first to wash the "goop" off, and then set in a [[UV Chamber]] to complete the curing process to it's fullest.

This technique cannot be considered [[Sustainable]], as the resin must be manufactured, and cannot be recycled with any degree of ease.
