# FDM

## Overview
---

FDM, or Fused Deposition Manufacturing, is an [[Additive Manufacturing]] technique that lays molten or semi-fluid material on top of many other layers to create a three dimensional shape. This material is often [[Plastic]]. 

Due to the requirement of the material to have properties of a liquid when heated, this is useful in [[Lost Material Casting]].

This technique tends to require the least amount of post processing, only removing support material. It is generally considered the cheapest.
