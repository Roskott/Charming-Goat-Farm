Rabbits are a species of Lapine animals that function as a pest animal. They breed rampantly and can decimate crops, especially those located on the [[Herb Garden | Herb Garden ]] and [[Vegetable Garden | Vegetable Garden]]

Rabbits can be harvested for [[Rabbit Pelt]] and [[Rabbit Meat]]. They are a good source of [[Protein | Animal Protein]], but are a terrible source of [[Lipids | Fat]]. A defeciancy known as [[Rabbit Starvation]] is named due to this quality. 

It is possible to raise rabbits as [[Livestock]]. This requires an additional building called a "Hutch".
