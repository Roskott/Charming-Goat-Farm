While on first glance these animals are not particularly useful, they will actively protect all animals from [[Coyote | Coyotes]] and [[Wolf | Wolves]].

Donkeys can and will protect form [[Bear | Bears]] and [[Mountain Lion | Mountain Lions]], though it should be noted they have a poor track record with them.
